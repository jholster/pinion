Streamlined CMS for Google App Engine. Aimed at technical people.

Basic concepts: 

- Text-based "resources" (html, css, js, django templates) stored in datastore.
- Each resource has a URL and can be either viewed by public or edited by admins.
- To edit or create a resource, simply add "?edit" parameter to its URL.
- Very minimal admin interface. No fancy editors, just one fullscreen textarea.

How get started:

1. Grab the source & deploy.
2. Log in with your Google account at http://yoursite/login
3. Go to http://yoursite/?edit to create your first page.
